VPL 0.3

VPL is a library to generate,manipulate and render vector paths.


base:
Path and 2d math(2d vectors, affine matrices).
Basic data structures and simple logging.

render:
The software renderer is based on: http://mlab.uiah.fi/~kkallio/antialiasing/  
In order to build rendering examples SFML needs to be installed and set up correctly.
The render part of the library can be disabled when configuring the source.

There are some small optional optimizations done in SSE, they need MASM to be compiled. The speedup is probably not drastic so don't bother with if you don't really want to :).

Compiling and installing:

mkdir build
cd build
ccmake ..
Choose configure options and generate
make
