VPL 0.1

VPL is a library to generate and manipulate vector paths as well as render them.
The software renderer is based on: http://mlab.uiah.fi/~kkallio/antialiasing/  

Basic data structures and logging facilities are part of the base package.

In order to build rendering examples SFML needs to be installed and set up correctly.

There are some small optional optimizations done in SSE, they need MASM to be compiled.

Compiling and installing:

cd build
ccmake ..
Choose configure options and generate
make
